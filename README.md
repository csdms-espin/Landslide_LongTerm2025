Modeling Landslides and Long-Term Topographic Evolution with Landlab

About the Project
This project explores how landslides shape the long-term evolution of landscapes using Landlab, a Python-based modeling toolkit for Earth surface processes. Our focus is on how vegetation and precipitation—two key environmental factors—interact with slope stability and influence erosion over time.

We simulate both natural landslide triggers (like intense rainfall) and landscape responses (like regrowth of vegetation), aiming to better understand how these elements contribute to the changing topography.


What This Project Does
Models landslide occurrence based on slope, soil properties, vegetation cover, and rainfall intensity

Simulates how vegetation grows back after disturbances and how it stabilizes slopes

Incorporates precipitation variability, from storm events to long-term climate trends

Tracks topographic change over time, combining hillslope diffusion, fluvial incision, and mass wasting

Outputs time-series data and landscape snapshots to visualize changes

Why It Matters
Landslides aren’t just isolated events—they play a major role in shaping mountain landscapes, redistributing sediment, and influencing how ecosystems recover. By combining precipitation and vegetation dynamics with physical models of erosion and transport, we can better predict landscape evolution over thousands of years.
